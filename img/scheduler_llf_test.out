Setting up this machine as follows: 
  Mode:         library
  Processor:    1 x RV64 at 1000 MHz (BUS clock = 33 MHz)
  Machine:      SiFive-U
  Memory:       131072 KB [0x0000000080000000:0x0000000087ffffff]
  User memory:  131059 KB [0x0000000080000000:0x0000000087ffcfff]
  I/O space:    524288 KB [0x0000000000000000:0x000000001fffffff]
  Node Id:      will get from the network!
  Position:     will get from the network!

Periodic Thread Component Test

This test consists in creating three periodic threads as follows:
- Every 100ms, thread A executes "a" for 50ms;
- Every 80ms, thread B executes "b" for 20ms;
- Every 60ms, thread C executes "c" for 10ms;

Callibrating the duration of the base execution loop: 7912 iterations per ms!

Threads will now be created and I'll wait for them to finish...

1000 A [A={i=-2143289178,d=1000,c=2151678000} B={i=IC::Exception(5) => {thread=0
x0000000087ffa8e8,sp=0x0000000087ffa680,status=0xa00001880,cause=5,epc=0x0000000
080001340,tval=0x0000000000000160} => data protection violation (read)

PANIC: unexpected error!
Rebooting the machine!
